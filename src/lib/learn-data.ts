    fact: "Some exoplanets rain glass or metal.",
    explanation: "HD 189733b likely has sideways rain made of molten glass, driven by winds over 7,000 km/h."
  },
  {
    icon: Sun,
    fact: "One planet orbits three suns.",
    explanation: "HD 131399Ab sees triple sunsets and sunrises every day—it orbits a trio of stars!"
  },
  {
    icon: Gem,
    fact: "There are planets made mostly of diamond.",
    explanation: "55 Cancri e might have a carbon-rich core where diamond could make up much of its mass."
  },
  {
    icon: Sun,
    fact: "Some planets are hotter than stars.",
    explanation: "KELT-9b reaches over 4,000°C, making it hotter than some small red dwarf stars."
  },
  {
    icon: Orbit,
    fact: "One exoplanet orbits its star in just 18 hours.",
    explanation: "Kepler-78b is so close to its star that its “year” is shorter than a single Earth day."
  },
  {
    icon: Wind,
    fact: "There are planets with no stars.",
    explanation: "Rogue planets wander through space alone, possibly ejected from their systems."
  },
  {
    icon: Globe,
    fact: "TRAPPIST-1 has seven Earth-sized planets.",
    explanation: "This red dwarf system, 40 light-years away, has three planets in the habitable zone."
  },
{
    icon: Sliders,
    fact: "Some planets have backwards orbits.",
    explanation: "Unlike Earth, which orbits in the same direction as the Sun spins, some exoplanets move the opposite way."
  },
  {
    icon: Sparkles,
    fact: "There might be more planets than stars.",
    explanation: "Astronomers estimate 100–400 billion stars in our galaxy—and possibly even more planets."

    {
      question: "What is an exoplanet?",
      answer: "An exoplanet (or extrasolar planet) is a planet that orbits a star outside our Solar System. Thousands have been discovered since the first confirmed detection in 1992.",
      icon: HelpCircle
    },
    {
      question: "How are exoplanets discovered?",
      answer: "Most are found using the transit method (detecting dips in a star’s brightness when a planet passes in front) or the radial velocity method (detecting tiny wobbles in the star’s motion due to a planet’s gravity).",
      icon: Telescope
    },
    {
      question: "What is the Kepler Mission?",
      answer: "NASA’s Kepler Space Telescope (2009–2018) was dedicated to finding Earth-sized planets using the transit method, monitoring over 150,000 stars.",
      icon: Rocket
    },
    {
      question: "How many exoplanets have been discovered?",
      answer: "As of 2025, over 5,700 confirmed exoplanets in more than 4,200 planetary systems have been found, with thousands of additional candidates awaiting confirmation.",
      icon: CheckCircle
    },
    {
      question: "Can exoplanets have life?",
      answer: "Possibly! Scientists look for planets in the habitable zone—where liquid water could exist—and analyze atmospheres for biosignatures like oxygen or methane.",
      icon: BrainCircuit
    },
    {
      question: "What is the habitable zone?",
      answer: "It’s the region around a star where conditions might allow liquid water to exist on a planet’s surface—often called the Goldilocks Zone (not too hot, not too cold).",
      icon: Star
    },
    {
      question: "Do all exoplanets orbit stars like our Sun?",
      answer: "No. Some orbit red dwarfs, some binary stars, and some—called rogue planets—drift freely in space with no star at all.",
      icon: Binary
    },
    {
      question: "What’s the most Earth-like exoplanet discovered?",
      answer: "Candidates include Kepler-452b, TRAPPIST-1e, and Proxima Centauri b, which are rocky and lie within their stars’ habitable zones.",
      icon: Globe
    },
    {
      question: "What are Hot Jupiters?",
      answer: "Giant gas planets similar to Jupiter but orbiting extremely close to their stars—so hot they can reach 1,000–2,000°C and have years that last only a few days.",
      icon: Sun
    },
    {
      question: "What are Super-Earths?",
      answer: "Rocky planets more massive than Earth but smaller than Neptune—possibly having stronger gravity and thicker atmospheres.",
      icon: Scaling
    },
    {
      question: "Can we see exoplanets directly?",
      answer: "Rarely. Direct imaging is difficult because planets are faint and close to bright stars, but a few have been photographed using advanced telescopes and coronagraphs.",
      icon: Search
    },
    {
      question: "What’s the difference between a planet candidate and a confirmed planet?",
      answer: "A candidate is an observation that might be a planet, while a confirmed planet has been verified through multiple methods or independent observations.",
      icon: TestTube
    },
    {
      question: "Do exoplanets have moons?",
      answer: "No exomoon has been definitively confirmed yet, but there are a few strong candidates—this is a frontier area of research!",
      icon: Moon
    },
    {
      question: "Why study exoplanets?",
      answer: "To understand how planetary systems form and evolve, and ultimately to answer the question: Are we alone in the universe?",
